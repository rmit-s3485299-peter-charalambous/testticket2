      <b>What is concession pricing?</b><br>
      Concession pricing is generally available for customers with proof of concession cards. 
      Concession availability varies depending on the event as event promoters reserve the right 
      to decide what concessions are applicable. This may include health care card, student card, senior card and pensioner card holders.<br><br>
      <b>Can I sell resell my tickets online on websites such as Gumtree?</b><br>
      Reselling tickets for a price higher than the face value is a breach of TicketFasts Terms and Conditions.
      If you have been caught reselling tickets for a price higher than the face value, TicketFast reserves the right to cancel your tickets.<br><br>
